    <p>I have been making this spaghetti recipe, from a dear family friend, for over 25 years. It is by far the best homemade sauce and meatballs we have ever had. I've also just fried the beef and added it to the sauce, then used it to make lasagna.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine beef, crackers, egg, Parmesan cheese, garlic, parsley, and thyme in a bowl. Form into large meatballs and place into a broiler pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and no longer pink in the centers, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer meatballs to sauce and continue to simmer, 2 to 2 1/2 hours more.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Serve sauce and meatballs over cooked spaghetti.</li>
        </ol>
